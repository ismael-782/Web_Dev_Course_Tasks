# 🌐 Web Development Course Tasks

Welcome to my **Web Dev Course Tasks** repository!  
This project contains a collection of mini-projects, challenges, and exercises completed during my journey of learning front-end web development.

## 🎯 About the Project

This repository serves as a structured archive of my hands-on practice while following a full-stack web development course. Each folder or file represents a small task, demo, or challenge intended to reinforce a specific concept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or responsive design.

### 🔍 What You'll Find:

- 🧱 **HTML basics** – headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, etc.  
- 🎨 **CSS styling** – selectors, colors, fonts, box model, layout, positioning, and advanced concepts like Flexbox & Grid.  
- 💻 **Responsive design** – media queries, float, mobile-friendly layouts.  
- ⚙️ **JavaScript basics** – DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive elements.  
- 🚀 **Mini-projects** – such as a Drum Kit, Simon Game, TinDog site, and various portfolio/resume-style pages.  
- 📦 **Bootstrap** – exploring components and layout utilities for faster UI development.

## 🧠 Purpose

These tasks helped me:

- Understand core web technologies step by step  
- Build muscle memory through repetition and variation  
- Create real mini-apps while learning  
- Organize my work for future reference and improvements  

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
